The project aims to develop a motion tracking software that can track, output, and analyse the 3D motion of a cyclist pedaling on the driver rig to characterise their geometric envelope.

Two main methods were explored: 
- Building a 3D maximum volume projection using two orthogonal profiles in Python using OpenCV (this does not give an exact 3D representation, but enough information to represent the maximum volume the rider would take up)
- 3D Stereo Vision using MATLAB and its Computer Vision Toolbox.
